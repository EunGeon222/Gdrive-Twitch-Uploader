# Gdrive Twitch Uploader
### <a href="https://github.com/EunGeon222/gdrive-twitch-uploader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a>
This code works on Google Colab.
### This requires "Client ID" & "Client secret" that you can get from Twitch. (https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create)

## Features
Once you enter and run the Twitch ID, the Streamer's VOD will be uploaded to the drive.

It will be saved in path /Twitch/replay on Google Drive.

Colab keeps working without having to keep monitoring.
### But, it only works for 480p for some reason in Korea.(According to my test results)
