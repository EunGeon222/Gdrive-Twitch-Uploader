# Gdrive Twitch Uploader
This code is possible to work on Google Colab.
### This requires "Client ID" & "Client secret" that can be issued on Twitch. (https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create)

## Features
Once you enter and run the Twitch ID, the Streamer's VOD will be uploaded to the drive.

It will be saved in path /Twitch/replay on Google Drive.

Colab keeps working without having to keep monitoring.
### But, it only works for 480p for some reason in Korea.(According to my test results)
